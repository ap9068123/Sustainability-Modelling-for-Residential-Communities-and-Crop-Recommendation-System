            <h2>Plan an Earth Day Event:</h2>
            For large-scale events, it may be too late to join in the 2023 preparations or planning committees, but the best part of Earth Day is that it happens every year! If the Earth Day bug has bitten you, talk to some of the volunteers at this year's festivals/celebrations and see how you can help out with future events.<br>
            <h2>Commit to a "Green Goal" Every Week:</h2>
            Each week, resolve to make an eco-friendly lifestyle change, such as riding your bike to work or being extra water conscious. Try to keep these resolutions going all year long, and make them a part of your everyday routine.<br>
            <h2>Join a Community Organization:</h2>
            Chances are, within your community, there are already a number of eco-conscious organizations, groups, or committees that you can join.<br>
            <h2>Set an Example:</h2>
            The best way to influence your friends, family, and peers about eco-friendly behavior is to set the example. Be sure that you're promoting green behaviors, making eco-friendly lifestyle choices, and paying close attention to lowering your carbon footprint on a daily basis.<br>
            <h2>Consider Carbon Offsetting:</h2>
            Total carbon neutrality is a difficult task. Purchasing carbon offsets is one way to make a carbon neutral lifestyle a reality.<br><br>
